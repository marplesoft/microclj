architecture outline

infra:
rdb - postgres container (for now), assume already running
message-store - message-db (postgres) container, assume already running

app:
core
    *env (interface, check for required vars)
    *rdb (interface, migrations)
    app-loader
        *global_app
        *app1,*app2,...
            routes
            handlers
    component-loader
        *comp1,*comp2,...
    aggregator-loader
        *agg1,agg2,...
maybe all top-level modules are components? not sure if that's needed for (reload) to reload everything.

rather than starting lein ring server-headless, or lein run, can just run a (start) at the repl and it will start the app and all components from within the repl
can reload there too via a (reload) which could be triggered via a hotkey ctrl-alt-c,.
